# 🐄 Animal Disease Identification using AIML (Lumpy Skin Disease Focus)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **deep learning-powered web application** developed to enable **early and accurate detection of Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) in cattle**. The system bridges the diagnostic gap for farmers and veterinarians in remote areas by providing **instant, accessible, and reliable predictions**.

The solution combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for disease detection with a **cloud-hosted web interface**, ensuring usability across devices.
